The application incorporates FAIR data principles to enhance metadata accessibility, interoperability, and reusability across platforms. A key feature is a custom-built, two-stage real-time XML validation system that provides dynamic feedback and detailed error logging to guide users through compliance issues. The backend leverages PostgreSQL for persistent metadata storage and querying capabilities. To ensure environment consistency and enable cloud deployment, the application was fully Dockerized, streamlining setup, scaling, and testing workflows across systems.GitHub: https://github.com/akash-2303/tethysapp-metadata_investigator",

            "At UF Data Studio, under the guidance of Dr. Christan Grant, I designed and implemented a large-scale data pipeline to analyze public reactions to U.S. election debates from 2020 to 2024. Using a multi-threaded scraping pipeline, I collected over 1 million YouTube comments and live chat messages in real time from multiple sources. To accurately link viewer reactions to specific debate moments, I constructed a timestamped, speaker-labeled transcript dataset using pyannote-audio for speaker diarization. I then developed a time-series KNN algorithm that processed over 26GB of vectorized comment data to map public responses to corresponding speaker segments. The insights were synthesized into an interactive dashboard using Dash and Plotly, enabling exploratory analysis of public sentiment dynamics across debates.
